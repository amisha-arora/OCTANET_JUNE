            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h5>Across the world,up to 811 million people do not have enough food. According to recent estimates,45 million people in 43 countries are at risk of sliding into famine – the most extreme form of hunger, which can result in death from starvation or disease. Indeed, parts of  Yemen, South Sudan and Madagascar may be close to or are already in the grip of famine. 
                The consequence of diets poor in vitamins, minerals and other nutrients are affecting the health and life prospects of millions more, and casting a shadow over the future of communities and entire countries.  
                Although enough food is produced to feed everyone on this planet, the goal of a world with zero hunger, as set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and specifically in Sustainable Development Goal

            <h2>Our work</h2>
            <h5>The moto of my school is 'Service Before Yourself’ so this ispired me to make this project.To reduce this universal problem, I have came up with a solution which can help to fulfil the food needs of people who usually sleep with empty stomach. 
                As we know that in India ,during any kind of function and celebration  a lot of food is left behind not only Here but even in our own houses and restaurants each time some food is left ,have we ever thought where this food goes? 
                This food gets dumped to garbage due to bulky amount.can you think that we can use this food... 
                Yes ofcourse we can use this. so we can develop an application through which all these people can inform the respective organisation , so that they can send their trucks or delivery vans there to fetch the left behind food. 
                And serve it to poors or hungry people
